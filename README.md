# Dog-Breed-Classifier-and-Information-Provider-web app-using-streamlit-and-CNN
These is web app developed using a python framework called streamlit which utilizes the dog breed image classifier model which I have trained it using CNN. The web app takes input image data either using web camera or by allowing the users to upload image files then the web use the model to  make prediction and classification and provide info. 

reminder: The second python file named DogBreedClassification.py uses pretrained model called mobilenet_v2. The other one uses the model that
I trained named DBC.h5. While using the these file you have to make correction the file path based on your directory.
